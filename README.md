# ITCSS file structure
Script generate itcss file structure (folders and index.scss files), create main.scss file and write imports.

For the script to work, you must clone the repository, go to the generate-itcss-structure folder and run the command:
`chmod u+x itcss.sh`

Then in the .zshrc file you need to add the alias:
`alias itcss="<folder path>/itcss.sh"`

Now you can run the script anywhere simply by typing `itcss`.
